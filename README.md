  - **user_id** – ID of the guest leaving the review (foreign key from Users)  
  - **property_id** – ID of the property being reviewed (foreign key from Properties)  
  - **rating** – Numeric rating (e.g., 1–5 stars)  
  - **comment** – Guest’s written feedback  

**Relationships:**  

  - A review belongs to one property.  
  - A review is written by one user (guest).  

### 5. Payments: Represents financial transactions for bookings.  
Important fields:  

  - **id** – Unique identifier for the payment  
  - **booking_id** – ID of the booking the payment is tied to (foreign key from Bookings)  
  - **amount** – Amount paid  
  - **payment_method** – Method of payment (e.g., credit card, PayPal)

## FEATURE BREAKDOWN  
The Airbnb Clone project includes the following main features, each designed to replicate core functionality of the Airbnb platform:  

### 1. User Management
This feature allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles securely. Users can register as hosts to list properties or as guests to book stays, making it the foundation for all interactions within the platform.

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings with details such as title, description, price, location, and images. This enables property owners to showcase their spaces while giving guests the information they need to make informed booking decisions.

### 3. Booking System
Guests can book properties for specific dates, with real-time validation to ensure availability. This feature links users with properties and forms the core of the platform’s functionality, as it enables the main service of short-term rentals.

### 4. Review System
Guests can leave ratings and written feedback on properties they’ve stayed at. This promotes trust and transparency on the platform by helping future guests make decisions based on past experiences.

### 5. Payment System
Guests can make secure payments for their bookings using supported payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, etc.). This feature ensures that financial transactions are handled safely and transparently, providing a smooth booking and checkout experience.

## API SECURITY  
Security is a critical component of this project to ensure that sensitive data and financial transactions are protected. The following measures will be implemented to safeguard the platform:  

### 1. Authentication  

All API endpoints will be secured with authentication mechanisms such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication. This ensures that only registered and verified users can access protected resources, such as managing bookings or adding properties. Authentication prevents unauthorized access, protecting user data like emails, passwords, and booking history from malicious actors.

### 2. Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to differentiate between hosts, guests, and administrators. For example, only hosts can create or update property listings, while only guests can make bookings. Authorization ensures that users can only perform actions they are permitted to, protecting system integrity and preventing misuse of features.

### 3. Data Encryption

Sensitive information such as passwords will be hashed using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt), and communication between clients and the server will be secured with HTTPS (TLS/SSL encryption). Encryption protects sensitive information like passwords, personal details, and payment data from being intercepted during transmission.

### 4. Rate Limiting & Throttling

Rate limiting will be applied to API requests to prevent abuse such as brute-force login attempts or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Rate limiting helps maintain platform availability and prevents attackers from overwhelming the system with excessive requests.

### 5. Secure Payments

Payment processing will be handled through trusted third-party providers (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) to avoid storing sensitive card details on the server. Only payment tokens will be managed within the application. This ensures that financial transactions are processed securely, reducing liability and protecting users’ financial information from fraud.

## CI/CD PIPELINE OVERVIEW  
A CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline is an automated workflow that streamlines the process of building, testing, and deploying the application. With   each code update, the pipeline ensures that changes are automatically integrated, tested, and deployed, reducing manual effort and the risk of human error.

CI/CD is important for this project because it:  

  - Ensures consistent and reliable deployments.
  - Detects bugs early through automated testing.
  - Speeds up development by reducing manual setup steps.
  - Improves collaboration by allowing developers to push changes with confidence.

Tools for CI/CD in this project:  

  - GitHub Actions – Automates workflows such as running tests, linting code, and deploying the application whenever new code is pushed.
  - Docker – Used to containerize the application, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.
  - Deployment Platforms – Services like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel can be integrated into the pipeline for automatic deployment to staging or production environments.
